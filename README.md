# SVHN to MNIST Domain Adaptation with UNIT

Tensorflow implementation of [Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf) in a Jupyter Notebook. The code is designed to be easier to read and tweak than the [original code](https://github.com/mingyuliutw/UNIT) and has mostly educational purpose. Hope you enjoy!
